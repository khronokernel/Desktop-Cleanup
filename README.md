# Desktop Cleanup

Simple Swift Project with 1 goal: Clean up my desktop of screenshots

* Supports both `x86_64` and `arm64`, macOS 10.13+.
* Runs once every 3 hours
* Only keeps 14 newest screenshots, moves the rest to `~/Old Screenshots`

This project is just for personal use, and not intended for mass distribution.
